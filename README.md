## Overview

A Weird Quest is a pixel-art **adventure & horror** game. It tells the story of a detective coming to a strange world to save a little girl's soul. Players (the detective) in this game will solve puzzles, unveil secrets, and eventually defeat the Devil which took away the little girl's soul. The average playing time is within half an hour. There are 7 different chapters in the game, each with 1 to 3 levels.  The core gameplay is to **explore** and to **solve puzzles**. In the last chapter, an additional **boss battle** is added. One of the interesting aspects of this game is the achievement system. I have designed **11 achievements**, 4 normal achievements and 7 hidden achievements. By unlocking hidden achievements players can access additional content.

## Why did I build this game?

I was inspired by reading **H. P. Lovecraft**'s novel collection during this summer. The story of **\*Call of Cthulhu*** deeply attracted me. So, I wanted to create a world that is also full of eerie horrors, allowing players to experience a weird and absurd journey.

In addition, I am no longer satisfied with designing simple puzzles involving collecting items. I wanted the players to really think and to analyze before they could find the answer.

Most games on the market today are featured with beautiful color graphics, but I adopted the black and white pixel style which I suppose can create a bleak, dark atmosphere.

## What is the game's main idea?

In this game, the gameplay is simple, the storyline is common, the art style is retro, but **to collect the full list of achievements requires logical thinking, trail, and sometimes creativity**. I always want to challenge both the players and myself.

## What did I learn during the process?

This game has improved my skills, as I have tried in this game what I hadn't done before: new puzzles, boss battle, achievements... I challenged my comfort zone. I, by completing nearly all the tasks on my own, have also gained a better understanding of the whole process of game development. So, it is essential to grasp more skills (programming, art, design etc.), to be a **multi-tasker**. Thus, I become very motivated as how I should proceed in future endeavors.

The game, however, had some flaws in the first edition, which taught me a lesson. You can encourage the players to think outside the box and challenge them, but you also need to consider the situation when they want to give up a little bit. I added a puzzle at the very beginning of this game. When it was loaded, a decreasing number would appear on the screen, from 100% to 0%. It was confusing for most players because regularly, you could enter games automatically after the loading process is done. But in this game, continuous left-clicking at the number is required to further the loading process. That puzzle was challenging enough but I forgot to leave a way for the exit. Some players failed to find the solution and wanted to quit right away. But I didn't implement a function for ending at that level!!! Players could be annoyed if they cannot quit the game normally. Then in the next version, I improved the level and saved the game. So it's important to keep up the **user experience**, even if you make something new.
